# you-cant-run-remix

you might know that I've made a couple YCR remixes before, but if you don't, they're in the files, go check em out if you want to.

but I've made a lotta improvements since then, like getting an actual good music program and figuring out what scales are, so I'm gonna take another shot at this.


the other two didn't turn out the way I wanted them to; the first one sounded really 'hollow' and the second one was way too basic (I put almost no creativity into it, the melody stayed the exact same)

but now I'm more confident in my ability to make an actually decent remix, which, combined with my improvements art-wise and code-wise, I'm certain that I can make this good, better than the other two could've ever been

(okay, maybe that's an exaggeration, but you get the point, I'm very confident and good at stuff now)
